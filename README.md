# credit-risk-classification


Overview:
    the main purpose of this analysis is to check the model I have in this homework by using machine learning algrothims 
    to see if the logical regression model is accuracte or not for this instance
results:
    f1_score = 1.00
    precision = 1.00
    recall = 1.00
    
    the results is a perfect score which rarely happens in the real work field




Summary: I would reccomend this model as a prefect model for a bank but may need some futher turning depending on bussiness priorites
